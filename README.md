# Floatr

Floatr makes sense of the [AIS messages][ais_wiki_link] in your local RF spectrum.

* View detailed AIS information for each MMSI
* Plot live and historical AIS data on a Google map
* Sort and search AIS sources by MMSI, ship name, or flag

Floatr differs from software like [OpenCPN][opencpn_link] in that it's intended for data visualization, not for marine navigation.  Floatr at your own risk.

## Requirements

* A working installation of [Floatr Pal][floatr_pal_github_link] is mandatory.  Please see the instructions for that repository first.
